# Book Club League

The Book CLub League is a platform that displays data from various book clubs across the world.

Users can compare metrics from their club with others, such as: book ratings, number of books read and more. 

This is the frontend where I am using the Vue.ts framework with Vite package. 

One of my current projects so stay tuned for screenshots and more!

Cheers,
Darrell
